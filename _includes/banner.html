      <h1>Hi, I'm Koustav</h1>
      <p>A Junior Scientist/Postdoc studying gravitational-waves astrophysics</p>
    </header>
    
    <p>I am broadly interested in <strong>developing gravitational-wave detection methods</strong> and using these detections to <strong>test general relativity in the strong-field dynamical regime</strong>. To this end, I develop searches for <strong>quasi-spherical binary black holes</strong> and apply <strong>machine learning techniques to facilitate gravitational-wave data analysis</strong>.</p>
    
    <p>I also conduct precision tests of general relativity through <strong>black hole spectroscopy</strong> and <strong>parametrized waveform analyses</strong>, while also evaluating the <strong>data-analysis readiness of next-generation detectors</strong>, such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope.</p>

      <p><em>By night... well, you guessed it right, I binge-watch web series or anime like it's an Olympic sport. When not glued to screens, I read story books or attempt to learn languages – currently wrestling with italiano (Non sto scherzando, giuro sulla pizza!) and mentally preparing myself for tedesco (sorry, German).</em></p>
      <p><em>I've also started "field researching" at a local biomechanics lab (read: trying not to faceplant on the treadmill). And yes, I cook – but only because starvation is the only alternative. My relatives claim it's "quite nice," which means I'm either decent at following recipes or they're very polite liars.</em></p>
