\section{Research Interests}


I am broadly interested in {developing gravitational-wave detection methods} and using these detections to {test general relativity in the strong-field dynamical regime}. To this end, I \textbf{develop searches for quasi-spherical binary black holes} and apply \textbf{machine learning techniques to improve gravitational-wave data analysis}. I conduct precision tests of general relativity through \textbf{black hole spectroscopy} and \textbf{parametrized waveform analyses}, while also evaluating the \textbf{data-analysis readiness of next-generation detectors}, such as Cosmic Explorer and the Einstein Telescope.
